# NLP_COURSE_PROJECT

The project aims to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system to automate the process of parsing resumes and filling templates for job postings. The proposed system uses machine learning techniques to analyze the content of resumes and extract relevant information, such as name,email,companies worked at,location, education, work experience, and skills. NLP techniques, such as named entity recognition and keyword extraction, have been used to automate the process of extracting key information from applicant's resume.
